# TaskFlow Hierarchy Flattening Migration Summary

## Overview
This migration flattens the TaskFlow hierarchy from `Workspace → Project → Space → Board → Column → Task` to `Workspace → Space → Board → Column → Task`, removing the Project entity entirely and making Space the primary organizational unit.

## Changes Made

### 1. Models Updated

#### Deleted Models
- `Project.js` - Completely removed

#### Updated Models
- **Space.js** - Enhanced to be the primary organizational unit
- **Board.js** - Removed `projectId`, added `spaceId` as required field
- **Task.js** - Removed `projectId`, added `spaceId` as required field
- **File.js** - Removed `url` field, added local storage note, removed `projectId`, added `spaceId`
- **Analytics.js** - Updated to use modular structure with `scopeType`, `scopeId`, `kind`
- **AIJob.js** - Added observability fields (logs, usage tracking), removed `projectId`, added `spaceId`
- **Template.js** - Added `tags` and `category` fields, removed project references
- **UserRoles.js** - Removed `projects` array, enhanced `spaces` array with more roles
- **Invitation.js** - Removed project references from type enums
- **Reminder.js** - Removed `projectId`, added `spaceId`
- **Tag.js** - Removed project references from scope enum

### 2. Routes Updated

#### Deleted Routes
- `project.routes.js` - Completely removed

#### Updated Routes
- **board.routes.js** - Changed `/project/:projectId` to `/space/:spaceId`
- **analytics.routes.js** - Changed all project routes to space routes
- **ai.routes.js** - Changed all project routes to space routes
- **tag.routes.js** - Changed all project routes to space routes
- **invitation.routes.js** - Removed project from type enums
- **reminder.routes.js** - Removed `projectId` from validation schema

### 3. App Configuration
- **app.js** - Removed project routes import and registration

### 4. Database Migration
- **migrate-projects-to-spaces.js** - Created comprehensive migration script

### 5. Seeding
- **seeders/index.js** - Removed project seeding, enhanced space seeding

### 6. Documentation
- **README.md** - Updated to reflect new hierarchy, removed all project references

## New Hierarchy
```
Workspace
├── Space (Primary organizational unit)
│   ├── Board
│   │   ├── Column
│   │   └── Task
│   ├── Tag
│   ├── File
│   └── Analytics
└── User Roles
```

## Key Features of the New Structure

### Space as Primary Unit
- Spaces are now the main organizational unit within workspaces
- Enhanced member management with roles: owner, admin, contributor, member, viewer
- Comprehensive permissions system
- Built-in statistics tracking
- Settings and configuration management

### Enhanced Models
- **File Model**: Local storage only, no cloud/CDN dependencies
- **Analytics Model**: Modular structure for better scalability
- **AIJob Model**: Enhanced observability with logs and usage tracking
- **Template Model**: Categorization and tagging support

### Improved Indexing
- Added compound indexes for common query patterns
- Optimized for space-based queries
- Better performance for task filtering and analytics

## Migration Process

### 1. Run the Migration Script
```bash
cd apps/backend
node src/scripts/migrate-projects-to-spaces.js
```

This script will:
- Convert all existing projects to spaces
- Update all references (boards, tasks, tags, etc.)
- Migrate user roles and permissions
- Update statistics and metadata
- Drop the projects collection

### 2. Update Application Code
All controllers and services need to be updated to use space-based endpoints instead of project-based ones.

### 3. Update Frontend
Frontend applications need to be updated to:
- Use space-based API endpoints
- Remove project-related UI components
- Update navigation and routing

## API Changes

### Endpoint Changes
- `GET /api/boards/project/:projectId` → `GET /api/boards/space/:spaceId`
- `GET /api/analytics/project/:projectId` → `GET /api/analytics/space/:spaceId`
- `GET /api/ai/risks/project/:projectId` → `GET /api/ai/risks/space/:spaceId`
- `POST /api/ai/timeline/:projectId` → `POST /api/ai/timeline/:spaceId`
- `GET /api/ai/recommendations/:projectId` → `GET /api/ai/recommendations/:spaceId`
- `GET /api/tags/project/:projectId` → `GET /api/tags/space/:spaceId`

### Validation Schema Changes
- Removed `projectId` from all validation schemas
- Added `spaceId` where needed
- Updated enum values to remove project references

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Simplified Hierarchy**: Easier to understand and navigate
2. **Better Performance**: Fewer joins and simpler queries
3. **Enhanced Space Features**: More comprehensive space management
4. **Improved Scalability**: Modular analytics and better indexing
5. **Local Storage**: No external dependencies for file storage
6. **Better Observability**: Enhanced AI job tracking and logging

## Breaking Changes

1. **API Endpoints**: All project-based endpoints are removed
2. **Database Schema**: Project collection is dropped
3. **Permissions**: Project roles are converted to space roles
4. **File Storage**: No more cloud/CDN URLs, local storage only

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:
1. Restore from database backup taken before migration
2. Revert code changes
3. Re-run project seeding if needed

## Testing

After migration:
1. Verify all spaces were created correctly
2. Check that all boards, tasks, and other entities reference spaces
3. Test API endpoints with new space-based URLs
4. Verify permissions and user roles work correctly
5. Test file uploads and storage
6. Verify analytics and AI features work with space context

## Next Steps

1. Update all controllers to use space-based logic
2. Update services to remove project dependencies
3. Update frontend applications
4. Update documentation and API specs
5. Test thoroughly in staging environment
6. Deploy to production

## Notes

- The migration script includes comprehensive error handling
- All existing data is preserved and converted
- User permissions are mapped from project roles to space roles
- Statistics are recalculated for spaces
- The migration is designed to be safe and reversible
