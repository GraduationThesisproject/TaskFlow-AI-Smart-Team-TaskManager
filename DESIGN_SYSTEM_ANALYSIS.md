## 🚀 **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. ✅ **Ship as is** - Your design system is production-ready
2. ✅ **Add the 3 high-priority components** if needed for your MVP
3. ✅ **Consider Storybook** for component documentation and testing

### **Future Enhancements** 
1. **Add missing advanced components** as requirements emerge
2. **Expand utility functions** based on application needs
3. **Add animation utilities** for micro-interactions
4. **Consider icon system** integration

### **Code Quality**
The linter errors you're seeing are just missing peer dependencies. Add these to fix:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.2.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```
