# Drag and Drop Implementation

This document describes the drag and drop functionality implemented in the TaskFlow application using `react-beautiful-dnd`.

## Overview

The drag and drop functionality allows users to:
- Drag tasks between columns
- Reorder tasks within the same column
- Reorder columns on the board
- Visual feedback during drag operations

## Implementation Details

### Components Updated

1. **DraggableTask** (`src/components/board/DraggableTask.tsx`)
   - Wrapped with `react-beautiful-dnd`'s `Draggable` component
   - Provides drag handle and visual feedback during dragging
   - Maintains task card styling and functionality

2. **DraggableColumn** (`src/components/board/DraggableColumn.tsx`)
   - Wrapped with both `Draggable` and `Droppable` components
   - Allows dropping tasks into columns
   - Supports column reordering
   - Provides visual feedback for drop zones

3. **KanbanViewLayout** (`src/layouts/board/KanbanViewLayout.tsx`)
   - Uses `DragDropContext` to manage drag and drop state
   - Handles `onDragEnd` events for both tasks and columns
   - Implements proper drag and drop logic

4. **useSpaceTasks Hook** (`src/hooks/useSpaceTasks.ts`)
   - Added utility functions for reordering tasks and columns
   - Manages local state for immediate UI updates
   - Provides drag and drop action handlers

### Key Features

#### Task Dragging
- Tasks can be dragged between columns
- Visual feedback shows where tasks can be dropped
- Smooth animations during drag operations
- Position updates are handled automatically

#### Column Reordering
- Columns can be reordered horizontally
- Drag handle is the colored dot in the column header
- Visual feedback during column dragging

#### Drop Zones
- Each column acts as a drop zone for tasks
- Visual highlighting when dragging over drop zones
- Proper placeholder management

### Dependencies

- `react-beautiful-dnd`: Main drag and drop library
- `@types/react-beautiful-dnd`: TypeScript definitions

### Usage

The drag and drop functionality is automatically enabled when using the Kanban board view. Users can:

1. **Move Tasks**: Click and drag any task card to move it between columns
2. **Reorder Tasks**: Drag tasks within the same column to change their order
3. **Reorder Columns**: Drag the colored dot in the column header to reorder columns

### Technical Implementation

#### Drag Types
- `TASK`: For dragging individual tasks
- `COLUMN`: For dragging entire columns

#### State Management
- Local state updates for immediate UI feedback
- Backend synchronization through the `useSpaceTasks` hook
- Position tracking for both tasks and columns

#### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient reordering algorithms
- Minimal re-renders during drag operations
- Proper memoization of computed values

### Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-select**: Allow selecting and dragging multiple tasks at once
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Support for keyboard-based drag and drop
3. **Touch Support**: Enhanced mobile drag and drop experience
4. **Undo/Redo**: Support for undoing drag and drop operations
5. **Drag Preview**: Custom drag preview with task details

### Troubleshooting

If drag and drop is not working:

1. Ensure `react-beautiful-dnd` is properly installed
2. Check that `DragDropContext` wraps the entire board
3. Verify that `Droppable` components have unique `droppableId`s
4. Ensure `Draggable` components have unique `draggableId`s
5. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

### Browser Support

The drag and drop functionality works in all modern browsers that support:
- HTML5 Drag and Drop API
- CSS transforms and transitions
- ES6+ JavaScript features
