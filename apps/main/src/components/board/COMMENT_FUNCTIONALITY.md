## Backend Integration

The comment system is designed to work with the existing backend API:

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/tasks/:id/comments` - Add comment
- `PUT /api/comments/:commentId` - Update comment
- `DELETE /api/comments/:commentId` - Delete comment
- `POST /api/comments/:commentId/reactions` - Add reaction
- `DELETE /api/comments/:commentId/reactions` - Remove reaction
- `POST /api/comments/:commentId/pin` - Toggle pin
- `POST /api/comments/:commentId/resolve` - Toggle resolve

### Data Flow

1. **Frontend** makes API call through CommentService
2. **Backend** processes request and updates database
3. **Frontend** receives response and updates local state
4. **UI** re-renders with updated data

## Testing

The comment functionality includes comprehensive tests:

**Location**: `apps/main/src/components/board/CommentItem.test.tsx`

**Test Coverage**:
- Component rendering
- User interaction (edit, delete, reply)
- Permission handling (author vs non-author)
- Status indicators (pinned, resolved)
- Reaction display
- Loading states

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the comment system:

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **Rich Text Editor**: Support for formatting and mentions
3. **File Attachments**: Allow file uploads in comments
4. **Comment Threading**: Better visual hierarchy for replies
5. **Comment Search**: Search functionality within comments
6. **Comment Analytics**: Track comment engagement metrics
7. **Email Notifications**: Notify users of new comments
8. **Comment Templates**: Predefined comment templates

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Comment

```typescript
const handleAddComment = async () => {
  const response = await CommentService.addComment(taskId, {
    content: "This is a new comment",
    mentions: []
  });
  // Handle success
};
```

### Reacting to a Comment

```typescript
const handleReaction = async (commentId: string, emoji: string) => {
  await CommentService.addReaction(commentId, emoji);
  // Update local state
};
```

### Editing a Comment

```typescript
const handleEdit = async (commentId: string, newContent: string) => {
  const response = await CommentService.updateComment(commentId, newContent);
  // Update local state with response.data
};
```

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready comment system that enhances team collaboration and task management capabilities.
